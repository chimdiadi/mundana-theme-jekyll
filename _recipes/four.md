If you already have a full Ruby development environment with all headers and RubyGems installed (see Jekyllâ€™s requirements), you can create a new Jekyll site by doing the following: Peter

```ruby
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
jekyll new myblog

# Change into your new directory
cd myblog

# Build the site on the preview server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```
